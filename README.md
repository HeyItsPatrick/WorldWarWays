Built to help with driving navigation in the fps Hell Let Loose.
Specifically targeted towards newer players trying to get a handle on the maps and driving vehicles, and detailed players making broad movement plans.

HLL has gotten better, but it can still be hard to find your way around the massive maps, especially as a new player. WWW serves to help with that!
Along the same line, vehicles still get stuck extremely easily, and it's always rough to have a full transport truck and crash into a ditch you didn't expect while looking at the map, trying to plan your route on the fly.
WWW has an easy to use point and click interface, which allows users to create super efficient routes from point to point on all currently available maps.

- Buttons at the bottom undo the last marker placement, start navigation, and delete the entire route
- Place as many points as you want, in order of arrival, and just press the start button to have a route generated for you! Or, if you need to make an adjustment, continue making or removing points after a route is made to see the route adapt to the additional destinations.
- Click and drag to move your view of the map
- Use the pinch gesture or scroll wheel to zoom in or out on the map view
- Open the sidebar with the button in the top left to choose any current map, or to access my Discord server for any feedback or questions
